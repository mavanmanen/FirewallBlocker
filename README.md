## Installation
1. Download latest release: https://github.com/mavanmanen/FirewallBlocker/releases
2. Place the exe and any dlls it comes with in whatever location you desire (I recommend C:\FirewallBlocker or similar)
3. Run the exe once and the registry entries for the menu will be added

If you ever move the exe, make sure to rerun it to update the location
